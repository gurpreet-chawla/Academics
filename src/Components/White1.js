                                </strong>

                             I started my life as a perfectly imperfect child with many flaws.
                             I am the kind of person who loves learning and was never concerned about the end result.
                             In my free time, I love investing, dancing and playing cricket. 
                             Money is something that doesn’t fascinate me but the impact and difference that could be created in someone’s life because of me.
